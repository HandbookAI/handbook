# @handbooks/planner

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e5bf54: First published release, with all eleven packages on one version.

  They are used as a set — a `@handbooks/cli` run loads the pipeline, which loads
  the analyzer, the renderer and the LLM seam — so a reader picking a version
  should not have to work out why `@handbooks/patcher` is two patch releases
  behind `@handbooks/core`. The changesets accumulated before this point would
  have produced exactly that: seven packages at one minor and four at a patch.

  Listing every package at `minor` is what holds them together: changesets takes
  the highest bump per package, so the ones whose pending changes were patches
  come along to the same version instead of lagging.

### Patch Changes

- 8141e26: Configuration is declared once and derived everywhere. A registry in
  `@handbooks/core` is the single source for every setting, and the CLI options, the
  environment variables, `handbook.config.yaml`, `.env.example` and
  `docs/configuration.md` are all generated or resolved from it. Precedence is
  flag > shell env > .env > config file > default, and every resolved value carries
  its source.

  Before this, exactly one of ~45 flags (`--title`) could also be set from the
  environment. Now all of them can, and eight LLM endpoint flags exist that did not
  (`--model`, `--base-url`, `--max-tokens`, `--timeout`, `--llm-retries`,
  `--llm-retry-backoff`, `--llm-concurrency`, `--extra-body`), along with six
  pipeline tuning knobs that were reachable from neither a flag nor an env var
  (`--read-batch-size`, `--max-chars-per-file`, `--assign-batch-size`,
  `--assign-workers`, `--organize-workers`, `--narrate-workers`).

  `handbook config` prints every setting, its value and where that value came from,
  with secrets masked. `--check` validates and exits non-zero.

  Studio's bind address is configurable (`--host`, default `127.0.0.1`) and the
  repo ships a container image. The Host-header CSRF guard is unchanged: binding
  wide does not widen who may talk to it.

  BREAKING: an invalid `OPENAI_*` / `HANDBOOK_*` value now fails loudly instead of
  falling back to a default. `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=lots` used to run at 16000 in
  silence; it now names the variable and exits non-zero.
